# wave_function_collapse
This is a tilemap generating C++ implementation for a game that I implemented for a simple strategy game. It should be reusable for other projects as well.
# HOW TO USE:

## StringMap

### Description
StringMap is a Class for containing and writing/reading data, a 2D array of tiles

The tile type is marked by one letter (e.g. 'W' for water).

The tiles are separated by delimiter ';'.

The functions that are worth interacting with outside the class: 
- StringMap::import
- StringMap::print
- StringMap::erase
- StringMap::write_to_file

## WFC
### Description
WFC is a Class for autogenerating maps. It utilizes the Wave Function Collapse algorithm.
The algorithm takes a sample tileMap (in the same format as StringMap) as input.
It generates a tile map of user defined length. The generated tile map will contain the same tile types as in the sample and those types will be laid out in a similar (but not identical) pattern. E.g. an island in water as input will
generate several islands of random size and shape surrounded by water. 
The output is a StringMap that can for example be written to a file (which in turn can be read by Map).
Some tweaking in the input sample file might help with
obtaining satisfying results.		
		
The functions that are worth interacting with outside the class:
- WFC::generate_map()
- test_wfc()
- WFC::print_* (all print functions are especially useful for debugging)
	
### Example use case:
WFC* wfc = new WFC("Maps/input_map_2.txt");

StringMap sm = wfc->generate_map(60,60);

sm.write_to_file("generated_map.txt"):

### Example of testing whether randomizing works (all the maps should be completely different)

test_wfc("Maps/input_map.txt",80,50,10); //prints the maps to terminal (zoom out in terminal to see the patterns)
